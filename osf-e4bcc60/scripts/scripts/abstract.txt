Quasars often radiate at several to ten times the Eddington limit of their central supermassive black holes. We propose a self-sustained, equatorial Penrose-like excitation that operates at the ISCO–ergoregion interface just outside the horizon as the spin approaches unity (a* -> 1). Even modest effective coupling (epsilon_coup ~ 10^-2–10^-1) yields on average 2–3 L_Edd, with occasional 5–10 L_Edd episodes when the dissipation footprint is extended and transparent (R_eff ~ 10^2–10^3 r_g). We adopt a phenomenological framework and do not fix the microphysics; the results depend on a small set of effective parameters (plotted luminosities are isotropic-equivalent unless noted). Crucially, the mechanism is confined to the ergoregion and equatorial disk—that is, exterior to the horizon and therefore empirically testable. We further outline three observational hooks (a hard X-ray/MeV shoulder, X-to-UV/optical lag hardening, and equator-aligned X-ray polarization) and an explicit null criterion for high-spin, high-Eddington quasars.
